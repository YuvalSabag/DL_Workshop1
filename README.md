## Deep Learning Workshop Assignment 1: Neural Network Implementation

This project is part of a practical deep learning workshop, aimed at building, training, and evaluating neural networks for   
**multi-class image classification** tasks. The primary goal is to understand the core operations of neural networks,  
including **forward propagation**, **backpropagation**, and **optimization**, while applying these techniques to real-world datasets. 

The task focuses on classifying bird species into one of **525 categories** using the **BIRDS 525 SPECIES** dataset.  

This project offers hands-on experience with essential deep learning workflows, such as **data preprocessing**, **model architecture design**,  
**K-Fold cross-validation**, and **performance optimization**.
