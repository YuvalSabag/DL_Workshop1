## **Deep Learning Workshop 1: Neural Network Implementation**

This project is part of a practical deep learning workshop, focusing on the design, training, and evaluation of neural networks for  
**multi-class image classification**. The primary goal is to develop a strong understanding of core neural network operations,  
including **forward propagation**, **backpropagation**, and **optimization**, while applying these techniques to real-world datasets.

The task focuses on classifying bird species into one of **525 categories** using the **BIRDS 525 SPECIES** dataset.    
This project offers hands-on experience with essential deep learning workflows, such as **data preprocessing**, **model architecture design**,  
**K-Fold cross-validation**, and **performance optimization**.




&nbsp;  
### **Key Objectives**
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand and preprocess the dataset.
- Build and train a robust **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for multi-class bird species classification.
- Apply **data augmentation** to improve model generalization.
- Evaluate the model using **accuracy**, **confusion matrix**, and **K-Fold cross-validation**.
- Analyze misclassifications and implement strategies for improvement.
- Experiment with **pre-trained models**:
  - **Fine-tune** pretrained architectures for the classification task.
  - Use pre-trained models as **feature extractors** for classical machine learning algorithms.
- Gain insights into CNN components, including convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers.
